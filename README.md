# React State Management - with Typescript

Curious about client-side state storage? I’ve grabbed 3 of the most popular and compared them in a statically typed environment.

## Project Goal
This project was created to differentiate between the many state management tools now a days in the React Community. I realized that it didn’t make a lot of sense to just listen to someone’s opinion. Instead, I took my own initiative and decided this would be excellent practice to also apply static typing with Typescript.

## End Conclusion
tldr. Zustand is extremely popular, and rightfully so. 

I’ve had previous state experience with React’s Context and Hooks, a solution previously praised by [Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367). As well as experience with Redux + Redux Toolkit (RTK), further maintained by [Mark Erikson](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/).  All these state management solutions are extremely durable, but I am also in favor of [Zustand’s](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) simple API, their easy-to-follow documentation, and how quickly it is to hit the ground running when state begins to become more complex.
